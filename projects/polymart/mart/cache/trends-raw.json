Tablet PCs do not have a CD/DVD drive and will not run Microsoft Windows or its applications. Tablet PCs function as a secondary device for casual entertainment purposes, and are not meant to replace a computer. They are ideal for use around the home and on the go with WiFi or 3-4G mobile broadband connections (pay as you go, contract may be required for service).","brandName":"RCA","thumbnailImage":"http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-ff18/k2-_f0ac3ec1-9083-4304-96a0-cdf7a69d23d0.v1.jpg","mediumImage":"http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-1a3a/k2-_8689c9c3-3db0-4bf9-8337-50e661ae3201.v1.jpg","largeImage":"http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-912c/k2-_4e20435f-6288-4f97-a2d2-b854c27c608e.v1.jpg","productTrackingUrl":"http://linksynergy.walmart.com/fs-bin/click?id=|LSNID|&offerid=223073.7200&type=14&catid=8&subid=0&hid=7200&tmpid=1082&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FRCA-Voyager-Pro-with-WiFi-7-Touchscreen-Tablet-PC-Featuring-Android-5.0-Lollipop-Operating-System%252F45804389%253Faffp1%253D2kbttuJvu-CwuB35Bb5qUCDmPWKs7ecAvdyyW2oQZTg%2526affilsrc%253Dapi","ninetySevenCentShipping":false,"standardShipRate":4.97,"color":"Charcoal","marketplace":false,"shipToStore":true,"freeShipToStore":true,"modelNumber":"RCT6773W42KC C","productUrl":"http://c.affil.walmart.com/t/api07?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRCA-Voyager-Pro-with-WiFi-7-Touchscreen-Tablet-PC-Featuring-Android-5.0-Lollipop-Operating-System%2F45804389%3Faffp1%3D2kbttuJvu-CwuB35Bb5qUCDmPWKs7ecAvdyyW2oQZTg%26affilsrc%3Dapi%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dreadonlyapi","customerRating":"4.288","numReviews":990,"variants":[45804389,45804392,45821427,45804394],"customerRatingImage":"http://i2.walmartimages.com/i/CustRating/4_3.gif","categoryNode":"3944_1078524_1231200","bundle":false,"clearance":false,"preOrder":false,"stock":"Available","attributes":{"color":"Charcoal"},"addToCartUrl":"http://c.affil.walmart.com/t/api07?l=http%3A%2F%2Faffil.walmart.com%2Fcart%2FaddToCart%3Fitems%3D45804389%7C1%26affp1%3D2kbttuJvu-CwuB35Bb5qUCDmPWKs7ecAvdyyW2oQZTg%26affilsrc%3Dapi%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dreadonlyapi","affiliateAddToCartUrl":"http://linksynergy.walmart.com/fs-bin/click?id=|LSNID|&offerid=223073.7200&type=14&catid=8&subid=0&hid=7200&tmpid=1082&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Faffil.walmart.com%252Fcart%252FaddToCart%253Fitems%253D45804389%257C1%2526affp1%253D2kbttuJvu-CwuB35Bb5qUCDmPWKs7ecAvdyyW2oQZTg%2526affilsrc%253Dapi","freeShippingOver50Dollars":true,"giftOptions":{"allowGiftWrap":false,"allowGiftMessage":false,"allowGiftReceipt":false},"availableOnline":true},{"itemId":47308692,"parentItemId":47308692,"name":"Xbox One 1TB Console - Fallout 4 Bundle","salePrice":430.66,"upc":"889842020083","categoryPath":"Home Page/Video Games/Xbox One/Xbox One Consoles","brandName":"Microsoft","thumbnailImage":"http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-97a2/k2-_54dd7cf7-c5cb-4371-a188-3b4d6c535598.v1.jpg","mediumImage":"http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-3c96/k2-_df9a27d6-3e90-4dd6-b609-c4a1d482854f.v1.jpg","largeImage":"http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-687f/k2-_cf62be1f-bffa-42f3-9437-1105fc453c70.v1.jpg","productTrackingUrl":"http://linksynergy.walmart.com/fs-bin/click?id=|LSNID|&offerid=223073.7200&type=14&catid=8&subid=0&hid=7200&tmpid=1082&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FXbox-One-1TB-Fallout-4-Console-Bundle%252F47308692%253Faffp1%253D2kbttuJvu-CwuB35Bb5qUCDmPWKs7ecAvdyyW2oQZTg%2526affilsrc%253Dapi","standardShipRate":0.0,"marketplace":true,"sellerInfo":"antonline","productUrl":"http://c.affil.walmart.com/t/api07?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-One-1TB-Fallout-4-Console-Bundle%2F47308692%3Faffp1%3D2kbttuJvu-CwuB35Bb5qUCDmPWKs7ecAvdyyW2oQZTg%26affilsrc%3Dapi%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dreadonlyapi","customerRating":"4.603","numReviews":58,"customerRatingImage":"http://i2.walmartimages.com/i/CustRating/4_6.gif","categoryNode":"2636_1224908_1224995","bundle":false,"clearance":false,"preOrder":false,"stock":"Not Available","addToCartUrl":"http://c.affil.walmart.com/t/api07?l=http%3A%2F%2Faffil.walmart.com%2Fcart%2FaddToCart%3Fitems%3D47308692%7C1%26affp1%3D2kbttuJvu-CwuB35Bb5qUCDmPWKs7ecAvdyyW2oQZTg%26affilsrc%3Dapi%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dreadonlyapi","affiliateAddToCartUrl":"http://linksynergy.walmart.com/fs-bin/click?id=|LSNID|&offerid=223073.7200&type=14&catid=8&subid=0&hid=7200&tmpid=1082&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Faffil.walmart.com%252Fcart%252FaddToCart%253Fitems%253D47308692%257C1%2526affp1%253D2kbttuJvu-CwuB35Bb5qUCDmPWKs7ecAvdyyW2oQZTg%2526affilsrc%253Dapi","freeShippingOver50Dollars":false,"maxItemsInOrder":2,"giftOptions":{"allowGiftWrap":false,"allowGiftMessage":false,"allowGiftReceipt":false},"availableOnline":false}]}
